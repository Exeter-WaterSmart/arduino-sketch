## ENG2015 Managemnt Challenge Project

As water flows into the meter, a propellor spins which 
generates a magnetic field using a magnet. The magnetic field
is picked up by a hall effect sensor. Each time the propellor 
spins, it sends out an electric pulse out of the signal wire.
This pulse is detected by the microcontroller which 
logs the number of counts occurred. Once per second, 
the program sends a signal via wifi to the Blynk server 
which stores the data in the cloud. 

By using a hall efector sensor and low-power microcontroller, we are able to minimize energy consumption making the system more efficient and cost effective over time. The hall efector also operates with a very high level of precision and repeatability, this ensures that the user will consistently receive accurate and reliable dta on their water usage.
